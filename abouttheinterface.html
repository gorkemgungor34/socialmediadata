      <b style="font-size: 18;"> <p align="justify" >After internal research and testing, it has been decided that the interface to run Naive-Bayes Classifier machine learning text mining method in background, which has way more success in an accurate way of analyzing tweets and predicting effects. In the interface, tweets are analyzed and an output is shown; yes, as tweets having effect; no, as tweets not having effect on financial markets such as stocks of Tesla and SpaceX, considering the analysis is being made on Elon Musk’s tweets. Naive-Bayes method had 79% accurate results on positive labels, while it was able to reach 77% accuracy on negative labels. Outcomes has been analyzed with respect to other text mining algorithms such as Support Vector Machine Classifier, Decision Trees, Bootstrap Aggregating, Random Forest, and Supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation as well.</p> </style>

      <div class="a">
        <p align="justify" >In order to use the interface, users need use monthly or yearly subscriptions after the initial 1 week trial period. Users get access to real time tweets and its predicted effect within the minute of tweets being published and get notification via mail in real time as well.

<div class="a">
    <p align="justify" >The team has signed long term agreement with machine learning developers and a web developer. Therefore, many improvements on the website and interfaces are expected. Also, results of machine learning algorithms and predictions will be improved in a much more accurate manner with deeper improvements on various complicated methods. At last, the project team is looking for partnerships to further improve the project and enhance user base. </p>
